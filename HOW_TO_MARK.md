## 1) Solutions

### 1.1) Where to find solutions?

Add `-Solution` to the end of a repo url to find the solution.

For this repo:

https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/JavaScript-Core-1-Coursework-Week1

Find the solution here:

https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/JavaScript-Core-1-Coursework-Week1-Solution

**If you do not have access to these repositories** Contact your City Coordinator to get access to our Github Team.

### 1.2) Using the Solutions Repo

These solutions are example answers not the only correct answers. Use them to inform your feedback on the coursework.

Look for marking guides in these places:

- The `marking` folder - Used to store multiple guides on marking
- `marking.md` file - Used to store notes on common problems we're trying to address
- `solutions.md` - A file used by students for notes on best practice

## 2) Before You Start

### 2.1) Feedback Guide

Please read this guide before you start marking.

https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/teams/education/homework-feedback

### 2.2) Marking Guide

When you see trainees make common mistakes, direct them to this marking guide.

https://syllabus.codeyourfuture.io/guides/marking-guide

For example, if the student is leaving in lots of commented out code, write a short response like this:

```txt
Great work so far!

It's best to remove code that you're not using. Read more about this here:

```

### 3.3) Style Guide

All code at CYF should follow this Style Guide:
