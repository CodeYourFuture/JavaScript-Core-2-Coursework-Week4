The exercises are split into two folders: `1-mandatory` and `2-extra`.

All proejcts in `1-mandatory` folder **must** be completed for homework. There are **3** projects in this folder: `1-alaramclock`, `2-quotegenerator`, and `3-slideshow`. Each project will have an `index.html` file which contains the markup for the exercise, a `style.css` file which adds specific styling, and a `task.md` file which explains the task for the project.

The `2-extra` folder contains exercises that you can complete to challenge yourself, but are not required.
